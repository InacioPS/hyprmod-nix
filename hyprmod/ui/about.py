"""About dialog — standard GNOME ``Adw.AboutDialog``.

Presents version, license, credits, and links to the project's homepage
and issue tracker. Attached to the ``win.show-about`` action, which is
registered in ``HyprModWindow._build_ui`` and exposed through the primary
menu on every page header.

The version string is read from installed package metadata so it stays in
lock-step with ``pyproject.toml`` — no hardcoded duplicate to drift out
of date when we cut a release.
