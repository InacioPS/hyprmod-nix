"""Detection and application of fixable Hyprland config deprecations.

Pure logic — no GTK, no GIO. The UI lives in ``hyprmod.ui.deprecation_*``.

The contract for callers:

1. :func:`scan` walks hyprmod's managed config and the user's main
   ``hyprland.conf`` (with sourced fragments), runs
   :func:`hyprland_config.migrate` in memory, and returns a
   :class:`ScanResult` listing files that would change on disk plus
   deprecations that have no automatic fix.
2. :func:`apply_to_file` writes a timestamped ``.hyprmod-bak-<ts>``
   beside the original and then atomically replaces the file with the
   migrated text.

Silent rewrites are deliberately *not* the contract: callers must
present each plan to the user and apply on confirmation.
